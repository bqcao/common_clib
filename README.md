DBScan

DBSCAN is a powerful and yet simple clustering algorithm. It's heaviliy dependent on the defined distance metric, well, like many other clusteirng algorithms outthere, also the way of the clusters forming is very similar to common sense of density forming.

Polyfit

Polynomial fits. Here I use the inversematrix to solve it.

Please feel free to grab anything as you see fits.
